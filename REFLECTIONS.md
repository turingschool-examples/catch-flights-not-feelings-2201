## Reflections-Aedan
I was able to complete all user stories, but not the extension.     
The thing works, although I did battle some annoying environment issues (excuses excuses)    
and had to restart my macbook in the middle of working. Such is life, and I still feel    
my work is a decent representation of how much i've learned over the mod. I do wish     
that I could have been able to tackle the extension, but it's all good.     
Thank you so much for all of your feedback and advice over course of the inning, I     
do feel that i've come a long way from that very first IC.
